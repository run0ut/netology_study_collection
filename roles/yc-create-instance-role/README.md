yc-create-instance-role
=========

Requirements
------------

CLI Yandex Cloud :
- [Documentation main page](https://cloud.yandex.com/en-ru/docs/cli/)
- [Getting started](https://cloud.yandex.com/en-ru/docs/cli/quickstart)

The role is supposed to be started against localhost, but no reasions could stop you from using it on any node.
The only requirement though, YC CLI has to be installed on the node against which the role is executed.
In that case, keep in mind that SSH pub key to acces YC instance would also be taken from that node.

  - `name`: Name of the instance.
  - `hostname`: Hostname of the instance.
  - `zone`: Data center zone of availability.
  - `ssh_key`: SSH pub key to copy for default user "yc-user". If not set, module will use default ssh pub key ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
  - `cores`: Number of compute cores.
  - `core_fraction`: Persentage of compute time guaranteed to the VM. Options 20, 50 and 100 are available.
  - `memory`: RAM in gigabytes.
